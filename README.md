# React Website Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up and run a React website locally.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- Git (optional but recommended)

## Installation Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone <repository_url>
cd <project_name>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
If using npm:
```sh
npm install
```

If using Yarn:
```sh
yarn install
```

### 3. Start the Development Server
If using npm:
```sh
npm start
```

If using Yarn:
```sh
yarn start
```

The application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000/` by default.

## Building for Production
To create an optimized production build, run:
```sh
npm run build
```
or
```sh
yarn build
```
This generates a `build/` directory with optimized static files.

## Running a Production Build Locally
To preview the production build locally:
```sh
npx serve -s build
```
This serves the `build/` folder at `http://localhost:5000/`.

## Environment Variables
You can create a `.env` file in the root directory to define environment-specific settings.
Example:
```sh
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://api.example.com
```
Access it in your code using:
```js
process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL;
```

## Additional Commands
| Command           | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `npm test`       | Runs tests (if configured) |
| `npm run lint`   | Runs linting (if configured) |
| `npm run eject`  | Ejects the project from Create React App (irreversible) |

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter permission errors, try running:
  ```sh
  sudo npm install
  ```
- Delete `node_modules` and reinstall dependencies:
  ```sh
  rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install
  ```

## Contributing
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add new feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`)
5. Open a Pull Request
